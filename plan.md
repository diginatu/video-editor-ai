# Video Editor AI Plan

## Goal

Build a semi-automated rough-cut pipeline for long-form recordings:

1. Stage 1: WhisperX in Docker -> transcript files (`json/srt/vtt/...`)
2. Stage 2: Python interval processor -> `*_intervals.json`
3. Stage 3: Blender headless script -> pre-arranged `.blend` VSE project

Output is a reviewable `.blend`, not a final rendered export.

## Current Status

- Project refactored from flat layout to `src/` package layout with `hatchling` build backend.
- `docker-compose.yml` implemented for `ghcr.io/jim60105/whisperx:large-v3-ja` with GPU reservation and persistent cache.
- `src/video_editor_ai/stage2/` modules implement silence exclusion on WhisperX word timings (word start/end) with a 0.6s per-word span cap to avoid inflated-end masking, merge/invert, min keep filtering, configurable pre/post keep margins (default 1s) with overlap merge, and GiNZA bunsetsu-based caption chunking split on silence gaps and keep-boundary crossings. Bunsetsu timing uses `ginza.bunsetu_spans(doc)` (GiNZA/spaCy) so particles and auxiliaries attach to the preceding content word. It detects large intra-bunsetsu character gaps (> 0.6s) from WhisperX misalignment and snaps the bunsetsu start forward to the later character cluster. Captions are preserved as transcript chunks, keep intervals are expanded to cover caption spans, and minimum keep duration is re-applied afterward to reduce tiny strips.
- `src/video_editor_ai/stage3/` modules implement Blender arg split (`--`), source metadata detection, VSE strip packing, caption placement, and `.blend` save.
- `scripts/run_pipeline.sh` implemented and tested end-to-end with configurable input (`--input-videos-dir`, default `src_video`) and output (`--output-dir`, default `output`) directories shared with Docker Compose.

## Validated End-to-End Run

Test command:

```bash
./scripts/run_pipeline.sh "input/2022-05-28 23.00.21.mp4" ja
```

Observed outputs:

- `output/2022-05-28 23.00.21.json`
- `output/2022-05-28 23.00.21.srt`
- `output/2022-05-28 23.00.21.vtt`
- `output/2022-05-28 23.00.21_intervals.json`
- `output/2022-05-28 23.00.21_edited.blend`

## Runtime Notes

1. WhisperX image CLI compatibility:
   - `--word_timestamps` is not accepted by this image tag and was removed.
2. WhisperX image entrypoint quirk:
   - Stage 1 currently passes a dummy `_` argument before the media path in `scripts/run_pipeline.sh`.
   - This avoids the first positional argument being dropped by the image entrypoint shell wrapper.
3. Container user mapping:
   - Stage 1 runs as `--user "0:0"` to avoid runtime errors seen with host UID mapping.
   - Side effect: transcript artifacts are owned by `root` on host.
4. Blender stability:
   - Stage 3 uses Blender 5-compatible sequence API fallback (`sequence_editor.strips`).
